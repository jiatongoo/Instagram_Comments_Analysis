"The app is good for connecting with friends, family and even potential business partners. However as of recently I've experienced some problems with the messages portion of the app (ex: themes aren't showing up on my end but are present on other person's end). Idk if it has to do with a bug but it happened all of sudden out of nowhere on both of my pages (one private the other public).

"Used to be my favorite social media app, but ""improvements"" have made it harder and harder to use and I find myself using less and less. The most recent terrible ""feature"" added makes the photo carousels autoswipe after 3 seconds. There is no way to turn this off and it is driving me crazy. You are not TikTok - stop trying to be.

"Instagram is the best of all the social media. IG is not just a posting platform, it facilitates the processs of getting one's message out to the world. The design functionality of the interface is intuitive and user friendly. It guides me to the best possible options without limiting or directing what I do with my content. No other platform is as responsive or even remotely aware of the unique needs I have.

Used to be a great app but there are so many more bugs and issues than ever before. Plus they are ruining their user interface trying to keep up with other social media platforms. Making editing videos in the app extremely infuriating. It's like they try to add all these extra features but don't quite do it in the right way so it actually ends up limiting what you can do.

The app has been glitching alot. Videos will not play and instead just show a black screen. Audios will not play either.

"Eventhough sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. The quality of videos uploaded to the site sucks as well as the recommended videos (Not Video Resolution).

"This app has so many frustrating aspects. The themes won't work, and when they do it works for 5 minutes then stops. The messages glitch out to where it looks like the messages have been deleted so you refresh the entire page. This happens whenever I open the app. Texting outside of the app hardly works.

"As a Photographer, Web Devloper, and Graphic Designer, it feels very limiting to use Instagram. The aspect ratio is set to 1:1 or 5:4, and the app doesn't respond to landscape mode on the device.

"Hey Instagram,iam a teenager 18 yo. Lately, inappropriate ads such as 18+ sexual elements have been popping up on my Instagram homepage. The ads are very disturbing, it is very inappropriate if these ads are widely circulated and seen by teenagers and other minors around the world.

"Fun to view, not to post. Instagram has continuously had a problem where it weirdly crops and distorts images upon editing - or sometimes not until posting - despite my manual resetting. I will often have to post 3 or 4 times before the images actually post without automatically cropping or distorting (such as half the image will cut off and be black). It's frustrating and dissuades me from using Instagram.",2,2023/7/2 04:25,fun view post instagram continuously problem weirdly crops distorts images upon editing sometimes posting despite manual resetting often post 3 4 times images actually post without automatically cropping distorting half image cut black frustrating dissuades using instagram,-0.8,Negative
